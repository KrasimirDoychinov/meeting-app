### Idea

The idea behind this app was for me to learn and train my JS, TS, NodeJS, and MongoDB skills while creating something somewhat complex.
The app works like an Instagram/Tinder mix. Users can create different posts that have tags. Users only see posts that have tags that they themselves have.
There is a user recommendation based on tags again. The chat portion of the app has two modes: Anonymous and Real. When the chat is Anonymous you see a nickname of the person
and a default avatar. If both parties decide to click the button Meet! then their real information is shown and the chat becomes locked. My idea behind this was this: if you are
comfortable sharing your personal information with this person, then the next step is for you to meet in real life.
